## Odyssey CLI Installation

To install the Odyssey CLI, open a terminal and run

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleancoders/odyssey-cli-install/refs/heads/production/install.sh)"
```

## Development

### Structure

All script files that are executed directly are in `bin`. 

`lib` is a directory of files containing helper and utility functions that are imported and used by files in `bin`.

`bin/install.sh` is the source file for the installer file that gets built a distributed to users. 

The actual built file that gets distributed to users is put in the top level of the project and is built with 
`make build-install`

All new files created must have executable permissions. To set, use:
```bash
chmod +x path_to_my_new_file.sh
```

### Testing

Running all tests in `test` directory: 

```bash 
make test
```

Running all tests and auto re-run on save (requires `fswatch` on Mac and `inotifywait` on Linux):
```bash
make test-watch
```

#### Creating a new test file
```bash
make test-file FILE=bin/my_file.sh
```

This will create a file `test/test_my_file.sh` based on a template test file that sources the given source file
and ensures that the created test file is executable. The corresponding source file must be created first. 

## Deployment 

We prefer not to make commits on the production branch, 
so build in the distributable file in `master` and then merge. Merges should be able to fast-forward.

1. Once all changes have been committed to `master`, build the distributable installer file: 
   ```bash
    make build-install
   ```
2. Push those changes on `master` to remote origin.
 
3. Merge changes to `production`, ensure tests are passing, and push to remote origin:
   ```bash
   git checkout production
   git pull
   git merge master
   
   make test
   
   git push origin production
   git checkout master
   ```

Build installer and run all tests: 

```bash
make all
```
